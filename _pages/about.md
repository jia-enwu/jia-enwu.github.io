## About Me

**Name pronunciation:** *Jiaen (pronounced “Jee-en,” like “G — N”)*

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Affairs at the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University Bloomington.  
My research lies at the intersection of **bureaucratic discretion, representative bureaucracy, and algorithmic governance**. Overall, I study how administrative tools, such as diversity regulations or predictive algorithms, redistribute bureaucratic discretion within public agencies and shape frontline behavior.

A central goal of my research agenda is to understand how bureaucratic choices respond to **shifting decision environments**. Whether the source of change is a demographic hiring mandate, the introduction of an algorithmic risk score, or an unexpected policy shock, I investigate three linked questions:

1. **How do these interventions alter the balance of discretion between political principals and bureaucrats?**  
2. **Through what behavioral channels, such as identity, information, or incentives, do they shape managerial and frontline decisions?**  
3. **How do these altered decisions affect equity and efficiency of governmental outcomes?**

Across my projects, I use quasi-experimental designs and rich administrative datasets to provide **causal evidence** on the mechanisms connecting institutional reforms to policy outcomes.

My dissertation, *Balancing Bureaucratic Discretion: The Role of Diversity, Policy, and AI in Public Governance*, examines how variation in discretion influences equity and effectiveness in three settings: workforce diversity interventions, federal contracting, and algorithmic screening in child protective services.

Before beginning my Ph.D., I earned my M.S. and B.S. in Political Science and Public Policy from **National Taiwan University**.
