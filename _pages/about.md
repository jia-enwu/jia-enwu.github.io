## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Affairs at the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University Bloomington.  
My research sits at the intersection of **public management, representation, bureaucratic discretion, and algorithmic governance**.  
Across my projects, I examine how institutions, diversity, and emerging technologies—particularly **AI and predictive algorithms**—shape bureaucratic behavior and policy outcomes in modern public organizations.

My dissertation, *Balancing Bureaucratic Discretion: The Role of Diversity, Policy, and AI in Public Governance*, investigates how variation in discretion influences equity and effectiveness across three domains: workforce diversity policy, contracting, and algorithmic screening in child protection services.

Before beginning my Ph.D., I earned my M.S. and B.S. in Political Science and Public Policy from **National Taiwan University**.
