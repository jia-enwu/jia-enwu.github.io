## Overview

This article analyzes **over 180,000 staff contracts** from the U.S. House of Representatives (2005–2019) to reassess long-standing assumptions about how legislators’ **race, gender, and partisanship** influence the demographic composition of their staff. Unlike prior studies that rely on small samples or focus only on DC offices, this study provides one of the most comprehensive examinations of congressional staff diversity to date.

## AI-Assisted Job Classification

Congressional job titles are extremely inconsistent (e.g., “Counsel,” “Leg. Correspondent,” “District Aide–Veterans”).  
To create comparable staff categories, we develop an **AI-assisted classification system** that:

- Trains GPT models using CRS guidance and McCrain (2021)
- Hand-codes an initial training set of 400 titles
- Conducts two human-coded validation rounds (200 titles each)
- Achieves high accuracy:  
  - **Senior vs. non-senior:** 93% / 89.5%  
  - **DC vs. district:** 84.5% / 88.5%

This method provides a transparent, replicable, and scalable approach to staff classification.

## Key Findings

### **1. Gender-based representation is limited and asymmetric**
- Female legislators hire more women overall,  
- **but not more women in senior roles**, where decision-making power is concentrated.
- Partisanship matters: Democrats hire significantly more women than Republicans.

### **2. Race-based representation is stronger and more consistent**
- Nonwhite legislators hire substantially more staff of color across senior, DC, and district positions.
- Race-based linkage is **stronger** than gender-based linkage.

### **3. Electoral pressures constrain representation**
- In competitive districts, nonwhite legislators hire fewer nonwhite staff—suggesting electoral incentives can suppress active representation.

### **4. Party identity is a powerful force**
- Democrats—regardless of race or gender—hire more diverse staff.
- Among Republicans, demographic identity plays a much larger role.
