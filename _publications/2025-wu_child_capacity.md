excerpt: "A stacked difference-in-differences study of predictive algorithms in child protection, showing that algorithm adoption reduces analytical capacity without improving operational capacity."

## Overview

This paper evaluates how predictive screening algorithms reshape frontline decision-making in U.S. Child Protective Services (CPS). Using NCANDS data (2010–2023) and a stacked difference-in-differences design, I show that algorithm adoption **does not increase the number of investigations** and produces a **substantial decline in substantiation rates**, indicating erosion—not expansion—of bureaucratic capacity.

I develop the concept of **routinized deference**, arguing that street-level bureaucrats under time pressure default to algorithmic recommendations, shifting their work from case analysis to verification and exception management.

## Research Design

- **Data:** NCANDS Child File, 2010–2023  
- **Outcomes:**  
  - Investigation volume (operational capacity)  
  - Substantiation rate (analytical capacity)  
- **Design:** Stacked Difference-in-Differences
- **Treatment:** County-level adoption of predictive screening tools

## Key Findings

### **1. Substantiation rates fall by ~15% after algorithm adoption**
- Indicates declining **analytical capacity**.

### **2. No increase in the number of investigations**
- Rejects the hypothesis that operational capacity improved.  
- No expansion in throughput.

### **3. Investigations take longer**
- Average investigation duration increases by **7.36 days** (≈14%).  

### **4. Effects concentrate among high-yield referrals**  
- Declines only among referrals from *professional reporters*.  
- No change for informal low-yield referrals.  
- Supports a **misclassification mechanism**.

### **5. No new racial disparities**  
- White and non-white substantiation rates fall in parallel.  
- Pseudo-algorithm tests show nearly identical ROC curves.  
- Capacity erosion is **uniform**, not group-specific.

### **Overall mechanism: Routinized Deference**
Street-level staff default to algorithmic recommendations under caseload pressure, crowding out analytical judgment and slowing case processing while lowering yield.
