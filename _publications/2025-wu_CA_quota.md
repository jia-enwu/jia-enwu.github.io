## Overview

This paper examines whether California’s board gender quota (SB 826) improved women’s career advancement beyond the boardroom. Using the SB 826 as a natural experiment, the study evaluates how increased female board representation affected: **female executives**, and **female employees** in the broader workforce.

The analysis reveals a **divergent pattern**: the policy generated a short-term decline in female executives, but a meaningful increase in women in the broader workforce. These results highlight distinct mechanisms operating at different organizational levels.

## Research Design

- **Setting:** Publicly traded firms headquartered in California vs. other U.S. states  
- **Data:**  
  - Female board & executive composition from Bloomberg (2016–2022)  
  - Female employee composition from LinkedIn profiles (Revelio dataset; matched using Jaro-Winkler name matching)  
- **Empirical strategy:**  
  - Event-study design comparing CA vs. non-CA firms  
  - Two-stage least squares (2SLS) using SB 826 as an instrument for the share of women on boards  

## Key Findings

### 1. **SB 826 sharply increased female board representation**  
Compliance was substantial: firms added women to meet the “one-woman” and later “two- or three-woman” requirements. Many firms with no prior female directors added at least one woman immediately after the mandate.

### 2. **Female executives declined in the short term**  
Event-study and IV estimates show a modest decline in female executives after implementation, concentrated in firms with low pre-policy diversity.

**Mechanism:**  
Evidence shows a surge in *first-time female board members* after 2018 and strong IV results linking board increases to first-time appointments. This suggests **strategic reallocation** that firms promoted their senior female executives to board seats to comply, temporarily reducing the executive pool.

### 3. **Female employees increased in the broader workforce**  
In contrast, the share of female employees increase significantly following the policy. IV estimates indicate that greater female board representation produced a **positive and statistically significant “trickle-down effect”** on workforce gender composition.
