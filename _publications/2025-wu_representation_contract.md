excerpt: This paper shows that bureaucratic discretion activates active representation only in agencies with higher shares of female managers, revealing that representational behavior emerges when identity-based willingness meets institutional opportunity.

## Overview

This paper provides a **causal test** of a foundational assumption in representative bureaucracy: **Does bureaucratic discretion activate the translation of passive into active representation?**

I leverage the **2022 expansion of WOSB-eligible NAICS codes** as an exogenous increase in contracting officers’ discretion. Using federal procurement and workforce data from 2015–2024, I show that discretion alone does *not* increase the use of WOSB set-aside tools **unless the contracting office has a higher pre-existing share of female managers.**

This pattern reveals an activation mechanism:  
### **Active Representation = Willingness (passive representation) × Opportunity (discretion)**  

## Research Design

- **Policy Shock (treatment):**  
  2022 Small Business Administration expansion increased the number of NAICS codes eligible for WOSB set-asides, exogenously expanding bureaucratic discretion.

- **Data:**  
  - **USAspending / FPDS** procurement data (2015–2024)  
  - **OPM STATUS** workforce records to identify female managers in the 1102 contracting series  

- **Empirical Strategy:**  
  - Difference-in-Differences (DiD) comparing newly eligible NAICS codes vs. never eligible codes  
  - Triple Difference (DDD) interaction with *pre-2022 female manager share*  
  - Outcome Variables:
    - **Bureaucratic intention:** WOSB set-aside usage  
    - **Market outcomes:** Final awards to WOSB firms  

## Key Findings

### 1. **Discretion alone has no average effect.**
The policy expansion does **not** increase WOSB set-aside usage on average (ATT ≈ 0).

### 2. **Discretion activates representation only when female managerial presence is high.**
Triple-DiD shows a **positive and significant** interaction:

- Agencies with more female contracting managers used WOSB set-aside tools **substantially more** after discretion expanded.
- Agencies with few female managers showed **no behavioral change**.

### 3. **Activation occurs for bureaucratic intention, not market outcomes.**
- Set-aside behavior shows activation.  
- Final WOSB award shares do **not** exhibit the same moderated effect.

This distinction highlights where representational behavior actually occurs **inside bureaucrats’ decisions, not necessarily in market results shaped by competition.**

## Theoretical Contribution

This study offers causal evidence that:

- **Discretion is not a simple main effect.**  
- **It is the mechanism that activates latent representational motivations.**  
- Passive representation (female managers) matters only when the organization grants bureaucrats meaningful choice.  
- Without willingness, opportunity has no effect; without opportunity, willingness cannot be expressed.

The paper confirms active representation as the product of two necessary components:  
### **Identity-based Willingness × Institutional Opportunity**
