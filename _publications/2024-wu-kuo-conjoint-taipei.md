## Overview

This article uses conjoint analysis to study how policy design can mitigate intergroup conflict surrounding ageing policy in Taipei City. We field a conjoint experiment that varies key policy attributes (e.g., benefit distribution, funding source, target groups) and examine how different configurations affect support among younger and older respondents.

## Research Design

- **Data:** Survey experiment of residents in Taipei City  
- **Method:** Conjoint analysis to estimate the marginal effect of each policy attribute on support  
- **Key attributes:**  
  - Who benefits (younger vs. older groups)  
  - How costs are shared  
  - Program framing and eligibility  

## Key Findings

- Certain policy designs reduce perceived zero-sum conflict between age groups.  
- Framing ageing policy in more inclusive, intergenerational terms increases support across both younger and older respondents.  
- Distributional features matter less than expected once policies are framed as mutual gains rather than competition.
